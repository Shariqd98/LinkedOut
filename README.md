## A CS329E Project by Logan Zipkes, Kevin Valdez, and Shariq Dharani

This iOS application allows users to create a profile and take a Myers-Briggs-esque personality test. The results will be stored with the userâ€™s profile, and from there, other users will be able to connect with each other and form groups based off of the personalities that were acquired from the initial test. Users can form these groups and message each other for whatever reason they choose: recruiting for a company, making a study group, looking for someone who thinks a certain way, etc.
